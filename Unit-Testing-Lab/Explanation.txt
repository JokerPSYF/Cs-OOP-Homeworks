An AxeTests is given
Create the following tests:
Test if weapon loses durability after each attack
Test attacking with a broken weapon

A DummyTests is given
Create the following tests:
Dummy loses health if attacked
Dead Dummy throws an exception if attacked
Dead Dummy can give XP
Alive Dummy can't give XP

Refactor the tests for Axe and Dummy classes
Make sure that:
Names of test methods are descriptive
You use appropriate assertions (assert equals vs assert true)
You use assertion messages
There are no magic numbers
There is no code duplication (Don’t Repeat Yourself)

Hints
Extract constants and private fields for Axe class
Create a method that executes before each test
Make use of constants and private fields, as well as add assertion messages
Follow the same logic for other test methods and TestDummy class
