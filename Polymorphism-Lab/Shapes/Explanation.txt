Create a class hierarchy, starting with abstract class Shape:
Abstract methods:
oCalculatePerimeter(): double
oCalculateArea(): double
Virtual methods:
oDraw(): string
Extend the Shape class with two children:
Rectangle
Circle
Each of them needs to have: 
Fields: 
oheight and width for Rectangle
oradius for Circle
Encapsulation for these fields
A public constructor 
Concrete methods for calculations (perimeter and area)
Override methods for drawing
