Define an interface IPerson with properties for Name and Age. 
Define a class Citizen that implements IPerson and has two properties string name and an int age.
The Citizen should accept name and age upon initialization.

Using the code from the previous task, define an interface IIdentifiable with a string property
Id and an interface IBirthable with a string property Birthdate and implement them in the Citizen class.
Rewrite the Citizen constructor to accept the new parameters.
