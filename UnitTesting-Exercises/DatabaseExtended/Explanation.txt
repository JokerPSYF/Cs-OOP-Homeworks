You already have a class - Database. We have modified it and added some more functionality to it.
It supports adding, removing, and finding People. In other words, it stores People. 
There are two types of finding methods - first: "FindById (long id)" and the second one:
"FindByUsername (string username)". As you may guess,
each person has unique id and unique username.
Your task is to test the provided project.
